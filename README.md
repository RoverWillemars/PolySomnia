# Polysomnia

**Real-time Sleep Monitoring & Optimal Wake-Up App**

---

## Overview

**Polysomnia** is a real-time sleep staging app designed for at-home use. Using EEG, EOG, EMG and ECG, the app tracks sleep stages and helps users wake at the optimal moment for a more restful morning.

Contrary to the plethora of sleep monitoring apps out there, Polysomnia allows users to **record multiple streams of physiological data simultaneously**, enabling high-quality sleep monitoring from the comfort of their own bed.

While it starts with an optimal wake-up feature, Polysomnia is designed to grow into a **citizen neuroscience platform** for affordable, large-scale sleep monitoring and research.

## Current Features (v0.0.1)
- Basic UI scaffold; ready to implement features
- FFT

## Key Features (Planned)

- Real-time sleep stage monitoring using EEG  
- Optimal wake-up alarm based on current sleep stage  
- Review and visualize data from previous sleeps 
- Simple and intuitive user interface  
- Optional post-wake experiment to measure attention
    - Examples: Reaction time test, attentional lapses, other cognitive assessments
    - Designed to evaluate whether waking at the optimal sleep stage improves alertness

## Project Vision

Polysomnia aims to bridge **scientific research and everyday sleep tracking**. Future features may include:  

- Full sleep tracking and analytics  
- Compatibility with a wide range of biosensor devices, enabling users to collect sleep data from whatever hardware they have available  
- Community-driven sleep research contributions  
- Affordable, accessible monitoring for large-scale sleep studies
